									<h2>Detecting Job Scams Online</h2>
									<p>Using publicly available information on a standard job-board website, my colleague and I developed an approach to successfully identify fraudulent job postings 95% of the time with 63% percent recall. Our objective was to identify the rare cases of scams on job boards to flag them in the future for content moderators.</p>

									<h2>The Role of Passing in NBA Success: A Network Science Approach</h2>
									<p> Does increased collaboration improve performance? Using network science techniques, I evaluate every NBA team as a network. Players are represented as nodes and a relationship between nodes as being instantiated by exchanging one or more passes; weight is added to the relationships based on the number of passes exchanged between nodes.  </p>

							<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
							<p>
								I am a public interest technologist where my objective in the workplace is to find the right approach to deliver value.
								I bring a systems thinking approach to my work: 
								rather than simply resolving an isolated issue, I work the solution space and consider 
								the entire system wherever possible.

								I leverage cutting-edge, technical methods to enable decision-makers to get better outcomes. This includes
								econometric and statistical modeling, simulation & optimization, machine learning, time series forecasting, big data tools, as well 
								database management. I am an experienced program manager and a certified Scrum Product Owner. 
								
								My career has allowed me to work on a variety of crucial issues, but here are some highlights.
							</p>

							<h3>2015</h2>
							<p> While in college, I started my professional work as an intern for the Iraqi Ambassador to the United States. My first day was 
								two weeks after the Islamic State (ISIS) captured Ramadi, the largest city in Western Iraq. The experience sparked a lifelong
								dedication to analysis, strategy, and risk. 
							</p>

							<h3>2017</h2>
							<p>
								I won a fellowship to live at James Madison’s house in Montpelier, Virginia for a week as part of a 
								program on American federal policy and natural rights with professionals from a variety of public
								interest fields. 
							</p>

							<h3>2018</h2>
							<p>
								I spent almost four years working for a national-security focused think tank, 
								the Institute for the Study of War, as a professional analyst leveraging proprietary software and unique tradecraft. 
								I authored more than 50 publications on national security topics, and my analysis appeared 
								in places like as The New York Times and The Washington Post as well as 
								Inspector General reports to Congress. When a protest movement threatened to topple a government in 
								2019, I led a team of six providing research and policy insight on instability in Iraq.
							</p>

							
							<h3>2021</h2>
							<p>
								I earned an MS degree with highest distinction from Carnegie Mellon University where I took classes in Data Science, Economics, and 
								Operations Research with world-class faculty from 2021 to 2023. I was involved in the Heinz Analytics Club
								and Students Using Data for Social-Good. I was also a graduate teaching assistant for a database theory course
								and an agile methodologies course. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>2022</h2>
							<p>
								While in graduate school, I worked at the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C, 
								in the Research and Statistics Division. As the FOMC debated interest rate increases 
								to combat the worst inflation in decades, I supported division wide priorities.  
							</p>		

							<h3>2023</h2>
							<p>
								I am a 2023 Civic Digital Fellow in the Census Bureau’s Economic Directorate working on developing the Census Bureau’s data 
								products on Puerto Rican households and businesses. The Civic Digital Fellowship is Coding it Forward’s highly selective cohort of 
								young computer scientists, engineers, and data scientists working on innovation projects full-time in federal service.
